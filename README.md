# Module_10_PHIBOG534_BCL2401_E02_Phillip-Bogopane_JSL10

## Overview

This project is an interactive escape room challenge implemented using JavaScript. Participants must solve puzzles and correct bugs in the code to progress through different rooms and ultimately reach the final room. The challenge involves understanding JavaScript promises, async/await syntax, set operations, and DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
-Vscode

## Usage

To participate in the escape room challenge, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Follow the instructions provided in each room to progress through the challenge and solve the puzzles.

### Styling Elements

The styling of the escape room challenge was kept minimalistic to focus on the interactive elements and code challenges. CSS was used to enhance the visual experience and provide a clean interface for participants.

### Challenges Faced

- Identifying and correcting bugs in the code to ensure proper functionality.
- Implementing asynchronous functions and understanding the flow of data.
- Manipulating the DOM to update elements dynamically based on user interactions.

## Areas for Improvement

- Adding more complex puzzles and challenges to increase the difficulty level.
- Incorporating additional JavaScript concepts and features to further enhance the learning experience.
- Implementing a timer or scoring system to add a competitive element to the challenge.

## Reflections

The project was a fun and engaging way to test and improve my JavaScript skills. It provided hands-on experience with debugging code, working with asynchronous functions, and manipulating the DOM. The interactive nature of the escape room challenge made learning these concepts more enjoyable and memorable.


# Overall Learning Experience

Overall, the escape room challenge was a valuable learning experience that helped solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts and improve my problem-solving skills. The hands-on approach to learning through interactive challenges was both engaging and effective in reinforcing key concepts. I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge gained from this project to future coding endeavors.
